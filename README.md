ONCE UPON A TIME there was a lovely princess.
But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort,
which could only be broken by love's first kiss.
She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison,
but none prevailed.
She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower
for her true love and true love's first kiss.
Like that's ever gonna happen.

## 🎯 BEHOLD OUR GRAND DESIGN!
## ⚠️ DO NOT DELETE

*An Ode to COBOL and Grace Hopper*

In circuits of logic and streams of code bright,
Grace Hopper's vision took programming to height.
COBOL, her legacy, business-bound grace,
Making computers speak English with pace.
A pioneer, teacher, and leader so bold,
Her story in ASCII, worth more than gold.
The Queen of Software, with stars on her sleeve,
Showed us all what women in tech can achieve.

Alright, folks, listen up! After sifting through a chaotic whirlwind of suggestions, ideas, and outright madness, I've distilled the essence of our collective insanity into one grand project. The theme that echoes the loudest, the vision that shines the brightest, is undeniably... *drumroll*... \"Kyoto: The Ultimate Cat and Cheese Experience\"!

Here's the plan:

**Project Kyoto: The Ultimate Cat and Cheese Experience**

*HEAR YE, HEAR YE!*
WELCOME TO KYOTO'S GRAND DISPLAY,
WHERE CATS AND CHEESE MAKE THEIR BALLET!
EVERY TEN SECONDS, A NEW SIGHT TO SEE,
WITH COMIC SANS FACTS ABOUT FINE BRIE!
A MOUSTACHE LOGO, OH SO RARE,
ADDS PANACHE WITH SUCH FLAIR!

*Features:* ✨
- **🐱 Cat Image Carousel:** A new adorable cat image every 10 seconds.
- **🧀 Cheese Facts:** Each image will be paired with a fascinating cheese tidbit.
- **🎨 Comic Sans Overlay:** Because nothing says fun like Comic Sans.
- **👨 Fake Moustache Logo:** The pièce de résistance, tying the theme together with flair.

Now, let's get cracking on this feline fromage fiesta and show the world that being unhinged is the new black! Onward to glory, my magnificent team of misfits! 🧀🐱🎩
